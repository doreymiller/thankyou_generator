#### Thank You Generator



The **Thank You Generator** is a web application project built in **Ruby** using the **Sinatra** framework.  This project is an optional assignment as part of **[the Launch School](https://launchschool.com/)** curriculum.   It is currently in a bare bones state, missing some intended Javascript functionality on the front end as well as the actual email functionality.

The purpose of this project was to solidify my knowledge of developing web applications using Sinatra and practice deployment of a "complete" application.  The source files for this project can be found on **[GitHub](https://github.com/doreymiller/thankyou_generator)** and a working version can be found on **[Heroku](https://thankyou-generator.herokuapp.com/)**.  

The idea for this project is purely my commentary on the often formulaic and tedious process of writing "thank you" notes.  As a former child and now the mother of children that are forced to write "thank you" notes, I would find this app useful.  The full vision for the app is to have more visual customization of the cards using colorful backgrounds and images.  Perhaps for the next version after I have completed the front end portion of the Launch School curriculum.
